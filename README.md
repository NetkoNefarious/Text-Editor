# Text-Editor
A simple text editor made in C# and WPF and using AvalonEdit for more complex features. Made by me for practice.

Features:
* Syntax highlighting
* Line numbering
* Font size
* Timestamp option
* Find and Replace dialog (not mine: https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/768408/A-Find-and-Replace-Tool-for-AvalonEdit)

What I practiced with this:
* Logic of new, save and open operations (including dialog logic)
* Placement of elements inside DockPanel
* Properties of many WPF elements (TextBoxes, Labels, Window, MenuItems, Buttons...)
* Containers (menus, toolbars, comboBoxes...)
* Implementing AvalonEdit from NuGet
* ApplicationCommands and shortcuts for default Windows locations
* Application Settings
* Command Binding
* DateTime
* Data Binding
* XAML and C# in general
