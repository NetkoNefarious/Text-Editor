# Text-Editor
A simple text editor made in C# and WPF and using AvalonEdit for more complex features. Made by me for practice.

Features:
* Syntax highlighting
* Line numbering
* Font size setting

What I practiced with this:
* Logic of new, save and open operations
* Placement of elements inside DockPanel
* Properties of many WPF elements (TextBoxes, Labels, Window, MenuItems, Buttons...)
* Containers (menu, toolbars, comboBoxes...)
* NuGet
* ApplicationCommands and Default Windows locations
* XAML and C# in general
